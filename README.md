To build the ODE library and example programs, simply type `make` in this top level ode3 directory.

Description of example programs:<br>

**RKnTest**: Solves a single 1st order ODE using the single equation RK4 solver and the ODE array solver

**RKnStep**: A basic example of the ODE array solver is applied to projectile motion with a simple model of air resistance, force of air resistance = -kv^2<br>. At each step in the elapsed time and x,y positions are printed.<br>
Optional parameters [default values]<br>
* -v initial_velocity [100] m/s
* -t angle_thera [45] degrees
* -m mass_of_projectile [10] kg
* -k coefficient_of_air_resistance [0.1] kg/m


**RKnDemo**: Solves for projectile motion with a simple model of air resistance, force of air resistance = -kv^2<br>
This program includes graphical output.  Detailed output is saved in TGraph objects in RKnDemo.root.  The file **RKnPlotDemo.py** shows how to access date in the TGraphs and can be used to generate additional plots.<br>
Optional parameters [default values]<br>
* -v initial_velocity [100] m/s
* -t angle_thera [45] degrees
* -m mass_of_projectile [10] kg
* -k coefficient_of_air_resistance [0.1] kg/m

Energy seems to be well conserved after the first few steps, at least for small step sizes.

**baseball1**:  Starter template for first baseball problem
********************************
(xend,z0,theta0) = (18.500000,1.400000,1.000000)
v_pitch = 48.255908 m/s
********************************

**baseball2**:
- gsl integration of 4 baseball pitches like in Fitzpatrick
- make and run for each pitch to create a single pdf and root file for each pitch
- run baseball2Plot.py to save all plots to a single pdf

**vterm**: cpp code to integrate and plot terminal velocity vs mass. This plot can be cross checked with the analytical solution of terminal velocity for quadratic air resistance given by vterm=sqrt(mg/k) where k is the coefficient of the air resistance. I drew the analytic solution on top of the numerical ode solution and they agree very well.

**baseball_drag.ipynb**: this notebook describes the drag force equations used in the text.

gsl starter code

The starter code here (projGSL.cpp) demonstrates very basic usage of the gsl for solving a problem of coupled differential equations. An 8th order R-K solver with fixed step size is used. You are encouraged to try other solvers as you explore the problem. See here for the gsl docs: https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/doc/html/ode-initval.html

This example solves the 2D projectile motion problem with a simple model for air resistance. After each step, data are stored in ROOT TGraphs, which are then displayed at the conclusion of the calculation.

The gsl provides a number of ODE solvers and a variety of interfaces.  Some of the solvers (not R-K methods) use the Jacobian matrix, which gives the devivative of the function wrt the dependent parameters.  See the gsl examples for details.

Python starter code

Two examples are given for using ODE solvers from the scipy.integrate sub-package in Python. In these examples graphs are made using matplotlib.

    Solution (projScPY2.py[ipynb]) using a more modern interface scipy.integrate.solve_ivp. See also: https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/tutorial/integrate.html and https://www.programcreek.com/python/example/119375/scipy.integrate.solve_ivp

    Solution (projScPY.py[ipynb]) using an older interface scipy.integrate.odeint¶ (see comments here: https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/integrate.html).  I do not recommend using this interface any longer.

The notebook versions contain additional comments on using the integrators.
